Strings are created in two ways
    - literal
    - new keyword
* When we create literal way, string is created in the "String Pool" (string constant pool)
* immutable: not changing
mutation: covid19 mutation(changing)
* When we use string methods: substring, uppercase method... string manipulation methods, the string is not changing in the memory, just creating another one

* Strings: squence of characters, each character has represantive number called "index number"
            String str = "Java";
                          0123
* is the length and index mean the same thing?
the length str = 4
