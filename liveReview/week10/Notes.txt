Exp 1:  we will create a method that will return count of even numbers, and parameter is an int Array

Exp 2: we will create a method that will return the difference between max and min numbers of an int Array

Exp 3: This example was implemented to show that we can call a method from other methods

Wrapper Class:
int, double, char, short ... primitive

Integer X = new Integer(9); ----> Value is just 9
X is called object reference
9 is the value of that object

Since X is object reference; I can reach methods of these Wrapper Classes


ArrayList: Can I put primitive inside Arraylist? NO NO NO
