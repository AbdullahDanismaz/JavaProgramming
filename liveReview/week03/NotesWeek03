Q1 : does the folder name (e.g., src, liveReview) have to start with lowercase ?
        package and directory names should start with lowercase
Q2 : System.out.print.ln(4+5 +" " + 4+5) it gives me 9 45 on the console.
Why it is not doing addition after the space?so, Why is it concatenating instead of adding after space?

OPERATORS
   * Arithmetic Operators
       - , + , / , * and modulus % (gives us remainder)
   * Unary Operators:
        + positive, - negative
        ++ increase alue by 1  (we will use these cretaing loops)
        -- decrease value by 1
        ! not operator

   * Assignment Operators
       difference between   "=" (assigns a value) and "==" (checks if the statements are equal)

       "+=" : a += 20;  ---->  a = a + 20;   Shorthand Operators
